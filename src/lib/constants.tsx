    question: "How does the audit work?",

Within 7 business days, you receive:\n\n• A CFO-ready savings summary report\n• A refund request email you can send directly to your bank.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe?",
    answer: "Yes. Your financial data is secure and confidential. FeeLens only analyzes your bank service fees, never customer or vendor details. Files are stored on encrypted servers, accessed only by our audit team, and never shared with third parties.",
  },
